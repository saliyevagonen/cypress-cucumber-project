Jenkins

You have 10 QA machines that need the newly created build installed on them for testing. After installation, the critical test cases should be executed on each machine. Design a Jenkins pipeline architecture to accomplish this, considering the following (description without an actual implementation is sufficient):

 A preconfigured .bat file is available to copy and install the application.  The critical test suite is written in Cypress.

 Local repositories exist on each machine but are not up-to-date.

Explain the steps briefly.

```Jenkins Pipeline Design```
    Pipeline Triggers
        The pipeline can be triggered in three ways:
            1. Manually (you start it).
            2. On a schedule (set a time).
            3. Automatically when a new build is created.

    Pipeline Stages
        Preparation
            1. Checkout Code: Get the latest version of the code and scripts from the central repository.
            2. Connect to QA Machines: Use Jenkins to connect to all 10 QA machines using SSH (secure connection).

    Environment Update
        Run tasks on each QA machine at the same time:
            1. Update Repositories: Run a script to pull the latest updates on each machine’s local repository.
            2. Check System Health: Ensure each machine has enough disk space and is connected to the network.

    Build Deployment
        Use the pre-configured .bat file to install the build:
            1. Copy the .bat file and the new build to each QA machine.
            2. Run the .bat file on each machine to install the application.
            3. Save logs to check if the installation was successful.

    Test Execution
            1. Install Cypress: Make sure Cypress is installed and ready to run tests on each machine.
            2. Run Critical Tests: Run the Cypress tests on each QA machine with the command npx cypress run.
            3. Capture test results, including screenshots, videos, and logs.

    Result Aggregation
            1. Collect all the test results from each machine.
            2. Combine all results into one central report.

    Notification and Reporting
            1. Send updates via email, Slack, or another method about:
            2. Whether the deployment worked or failed on each machine.
            3. The test results, highlighting any failures.
    
    Technical Details
            1. Parallelism: Run tasks at the same time on all QA machines to speed things up.
            2. Configuration Management: Store the connection details for each QA machine in Jenkins credentials or a safe config file.

    Error Handling:
            1. If something goes wrong with one machine, don’t stop the whole pipeline.
            2. Keep logs to help debug any issues.
    Post-build Actions:
            1. Clean up any temporary files on QA machines after testing.
            2. Save logs and test results.
    Plugins You’ll Need
            1. SSH Pipeline Steps: To run tasks on QA machines remotely.
            2. Cypress Plugin: For Cypress integration with Jenkins.
            3. JUnit: To report test results.
            4. Email or Slack Notification: For sending alerts.
